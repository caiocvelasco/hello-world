# hello-world
My first repository
Hi! My name is Caio and I am starting my career in Data Science :)
I am starting by learning Git, Github, Python, and SQL.
I already have a stong basis of mathematics, statistics, economics, and econometrics because I started my PhD in Economics but had to stop it during COVID-19 for personal reasons.
